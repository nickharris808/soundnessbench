"""Documentation parity.

Every published repository in this portfolio carries the same eight documents. A
reader who arrives at one of them should not have to discover that the
troubleshooting guide exists only in a different repository, and a contributor
should not have to guess where the trust boundary is written down.

These are shape checks, not prose reviews -- but a missing file and a stub file
both fail, because a heading with nothing under it is worse than an honest gap.
